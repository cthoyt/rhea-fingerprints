# rhea-drfp

This repository
generates [differential reaction fingerprints](https://github.com/reymond-group/drfp) for reactions
in [Rhea](https://www.rhea-db.org).

## üöÄ Usage

Installation of the requirements and running of the build script are handled with `tox`. The current
version of Rhea is looked up with [`bioversions`](https://github.com/cthoyt/bioversions) so the
provenance of the data can be properly traced. Run with:

```shell
$ pip install tox
$ tox
```

The SMILES dataframe and DRFP-derived fingerprint dataframe can be loaded from GitHub with:

```python
import pandas as pd

smiles_url = "https://github.com/cthoyt/rhea-drfp/raw/main/output/119/reaction_smiles.tsv"
smiles_df = pd.read_csv(smiles_url, sep="\t")

fingerprint_url = "https://github.com/cthoyt/rhea-drfp/raw/main/output/119/reaction_fingerprints.pkl.gz"
fingerprint_df = pd.read_pickle(fingerprint_url)
```
