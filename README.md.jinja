# rhea-fingerprints

This repository
generates [differential reaction fingerprints](https://github.com/reymond-group/drfp) for reactions
in [Rhea](https://www.rhea-db.org).

## üöÄ Usage

Installation of the requirements and running of the build script are handled with `tox`. The current
version of Rhea is looked up with [`bioversions`](https://github.com/cthoyt/bioversions) so the
provenance of the data can be properly traced. Run with:

```shell
$ pip install tox
$ tox
```

The SMILES dataframe and DRFP-derived fingerprint dataframe can be loaded from GitHub with:

```python
import pandas as pd

smiles_url = "https://github.com/cthoyt/rhea-fingerprints/raw/main/output/{{ version }}/reaction_smiles.tsv"
smiles_df = pd.read_csv(smiles_url, sep="\t")

fingerprint_url = "https://github.com/cthoyt/rhea-fingerprints/raw/main/output/{{ version }}/reaction_fingerprints.tsv.gz"
fingerprint_df = pd.read_csv(fingerprint_url, sep="\t", index_col=0)
```

Here's a 2D PCA scatterplot of the embeddings:

Future work: figure out what's going on in these clusters. I'd bet they correspond to different
reaction types enzyme classes, but the rhea-EC code mapping doesn't cover _any_ of them for
some reason.
